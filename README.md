# ToastySnapsBot

ToastyNetworks used to be the biggest modded Minecraft community of the world. With weekly events, it helps to have things automated as much as possible. 
This bot takes care of that. There was a specific competition, ToastySnaps. Players upload images / links for a specific theme to contenst which image 
is the nicest (rated by the players with reactions). This bot detects those images, and adds reactions automatically which people can click to rate.
Aside from this, it filters out any non image(s) posted in the channel.
